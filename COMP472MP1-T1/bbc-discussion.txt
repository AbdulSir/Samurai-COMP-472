By observing the plot of instances in each class we notice that the 'business' and 'sport' classes 
have relatively higher instances than the other classes. Therefore, the accuracy metric is not well-suited
for this kind of data. Moreover, the f1-score for each class is the most suited metric because it penalizes
the extreme values.

When we ran step 8, the performance remained the same because we didn't change a thing. However, when we
added smoothing, the overall performance of our prediction was increased. The 0.0001 smoothing resulted in
the best performance because we have eliminated the zero problem, and our data is not greatly impacted by
the features that had 0 occurences, as it is with the 0.9 smoothing. With 0.9 smoothing, our performance 
metrics were increased but remained less than the performance metrics of 0.0001 smoothing model.
